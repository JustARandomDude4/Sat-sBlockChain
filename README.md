## How I made 📋
* Step1 :
> Create and initialise a new node.js project :
```
npm init
npm install -D typescript @types/nodes
npm install node
```
* Step 2:
> Create a  new file, 'tsconfig.json'. In this add the compilerOptions, to tell the compiler how it should compile the .ts files. (copy paste my tsocnfig.json file)
> Now in the package.json file, and create a script-
```
dev :tsc-w"    
// this is added with -w which is a watch flaa, to tell constantly compile our code to plain js
```
>Create an index.ts file

* Step 3:
> Now my Basic structure is to have 4 different classes. 
>>  1. Transaction
>>  2. Block
>>  3. Chain
>>  4. Wallet
